# Graphs-Embeddings

(TODO: Set up project in a virtual env to make project easier to clone and setup. Was facing some technical difficulties so for now, this is less elegantly organized than it could be.) 

## Setup 

1. Download and install the following:

[NetworkX](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/networkx/) 

[nxpd](https://github.com/chebee7i/nxpd)

It is intended that NetworkX is used for graph analysis moving forward. [Snap.py.](http://snap.stanford.edu/snappy/index.html) and [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org) were also briefly used. 

2. Download Wikipedia 2014 + Gigaword 5 pre-trained vectors from [GloVe](http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) and place in a folder called "glove" in main directory.
